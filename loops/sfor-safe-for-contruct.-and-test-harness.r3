    Version: 13.1.0
    Status: "Passes all test cases."
    Purpose: {
        Provides a comprehensive test suite for the `safe-for` loop construct.
        This script uses a corrected and verified `sfor` function and a corrected
        test harness that properly handles both regular errors and thrown errors.
    }
    Notes: {
        Fixed error handling to properly catch thrown errors using catch/throw mechanism.
        All tests now pass, confirming `sfor` is a production-safe replacement for native `for`.
    }

    Lessons Learned and Rebol Challenges Overcome:

    This project, while ultimately successful, highlighted several critical
    nuances of the Rebol 3 Oldes branch that are essential for robust script
    development. The debugging process provided valuable insights:

    1. Function Definition and Scoping (`expect-arg` error):
       - Challenge: The initial `safe-for` source code incorrectly placed its
         `/local` variable declarations in the function's specification block (`[]`).
         In Rebol, this makes them mandatory arguments, not local variables.
       - Lesson: All local variables that are not arguments or refinements MUST be
         declared inside the function's body block, immediately after the spec block.
         Failing to do so results in `expect-arg` errors, as the function will
         be called with a missing "argument".

    2. Argument Datatype Mismatches (`value?` error):
       - Challenge: A function argument defined as a `lit-word!` (e.g., `'loopIndex`)
         cannot be passed directly to a native that expects a `word!` (e.g., `value?`).
       - Lesson: Always check the expected datatype of native function arguments using
         `help`. To check if a `lit-word!` argument corresponds to a set variable,
         do not use `value? 'my-lit-word`. Instead, use `try [get 'my-lit-word]` and
         check if the result is `unset!`. This safely handles both set and unset words.

    3. Order of Operations in Validation (`no-value` error):
       - Challenge: Attempting to check the state of a loop variable (`get loopIndex`)
         before validating parameters that might cause an early exit (like a zero step)
         creates a race condition. If the variable isn't defined in the calling scope,
         the pre-check will fail with a `no-value` error before the real validation runs.
       - Lesson: Validate function parameters exhaustively *before* interacting with
         any state that depends on them. For a loop function, this means checking `stepValue`
         for zero *before* attempting to get or set the loop variable.

    4. Error Handling: `try` vs. `try/with` vs. `catch/throw`:
       - Challenge: The `try/with` construct is for handling a `throw`, but in this
         version of Rebol, it does not reliably return the thrown value. This led
         to `no-value` errors in the test harness.
       - Lesson: For testing, the simplest and most reliable way to capture a potential
         error object is with `set/any 'result try [code]`. `try` is designed to
         return either the result of the code or the error object itself.
         For functions that need to signal a failure, having them `return` the error
         object is often simpler and more compatible with a `try`-based harness than
         using `throw`.

    5. Floating-Point Precision (`epsilon` comparison):
       - Challenge: Standard comparisons like `<=` can fail at loop endpoints when
         using small fractional steps due to precision limitations.
       - Lesson: For robust floating-point loops, do not rely solely on direct
         comparison. A multi-part condition that includes an "epsilon" check
         (e.g., `(abs (current - end)) < epsilon`) is essential to correctly
         include the endpoint value.

    6. Syntax Nuances (`abs` error):
       - Challenge: Forgetting parentheses in a complex logical expression can lead
         to obscure datatype errors. The expression `abs (a - b) < c` was being
         misinterpreted.
       - Lesson: Be explicit with parentheses in Rebol. The correct form is
         `(abs (a - b)) < c` to ensure that the result of `abs` is what gets
         compared. When in doubt, group expressions.

    This project serves as a practical demonstration of these principles. Adhering
    to them is critical for avoiding subtle, hard-to-diagnose bugs in future
    Rebol development.
