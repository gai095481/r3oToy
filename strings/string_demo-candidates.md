Based on the existing string manipulation demonstration framework, several additional Rebol string operations would provide valuable educational examples while showcasing the language's functional capabilities and refinement system.

## Pattern Matching and Parsing Operations

The `parse` function represents one of Rebol's most distinctive features and would significantly enhance the demonstration suite. Examples could include validating email formats, extracting specific data patterns from structured text, or tokenizing delimited data. The `parse` function's rule-based approach demonstrates Rebol's dialect capabilities while providing practical text processing solutions.

String pattern operations using `find` with various refinements offer substantial educational value. The `/case`, `/any`, `/with`, and `/match` refinements demonstrate how Rebol's refinement system extends function behavior. Examples could include case-sensitive searching, wildcard pattern matching, and position-based text location operations.

## Advanced String Transformation Functions

The `split` function with its refinements provides excellent demonstration opportunities for data processing scenarios. Examples could show splitting CSV data, parsing configuration files, or breaking text into lines or words using different delimiter strategies. The `/at` and `/into` refinements showcase different approaches to string segmentation.

String encoding and decoding operations using `enbase` and `debase` functions would demonstrate practical data handling scenarios. Examples could include Base64 encoding for data transmission, URL encoding for web applications, or hexadecimal conversions for data representation tasks.

## Format String Operations

The `form` and `mold` functions offer opportunities to demonstrate data serialization and string representation techniques. Examples could show converting complex data structures to readable strings, formatting numeric values with specific precision, or creating human-readable output from programmatic data.

Template string operations using `reform` and `remold` would showcase dynamic string construction techniques. These examples could demonstrate report generation, message formatting, or configuration file creation from template patterns.

## String Analysis and Measurement Functions

Character analysis operations using functions like `found?`, `index?`, and `length?` provide foundational string processing examples. These could demonstrate text statistics calculation, string validation checks, or position-based text analysis operations.

String comparison operations beyond basic equality checking would showcase the `equal?`, `same?`, and `strict-equal?` functions with various refinements. Examples could demonstrate different comparison semantics and their appropriate use cases in text processing applications.

## File Path and URL String Operations

File path manipulation using `clean-path`, `split-path`, and `to-file` functions would demonstrate practical system administration and file management scenarios. These examples would show portable path handling, filename extraction, and directory navigation operations.

URL string processing using `decode-url` and related functions would provide web development context examples. These could demonstrate parameter extraction, URL construction, and web address validation techniques.

## Implementation Considerations

Each additional demonstration should follow the established validation framework pattern, ensuring consistent result verification and educational value. The examples should progressively increase in complexity, building upon previously demonstrated concepts while introducing new functional paradigms.

The refinement system demonstrations should clearly illustrate how refinements modify function behavior, providing concrete examples of how the same base function can serve multiple related purposes through refinement application. This approach effectively demonstrates Rebol's philosophy of semantic clarity through explicit function modification rather than overloaded function signatures.

These additional string operations would create a comprehensive educational resource that spans from basic text manipulation through advanced parsing and formatting scenarios, providing practical examples that developers can adapt for real-world applications.
