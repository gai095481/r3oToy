TECHNICAL RESOLUTION NOTES
==============================================================================
This script underwent significant architectural improvements to address critical
issues related to function scoping, state management and string manipulation
within the Rebol 3 Oldes Branch environment.

PRIMARY CHALLENGES ADDRESSED:

1. Variable Scoping Conflicts with Function Constructor:
   Problem: The original implementation used a mixed approach of 'func' and
   'function' constructors, leading to variable scoping inconsistencies. When
   'function' was applied uniformly, global variables became shadowed by
   automatic local bindings, causing "copy does not allow #(none!) for its
   value argument" errors.

   Resolution: Implemented explicit parameter passing throughout the test
   suite. Functions that require access to the base test string now receive
   it as a typed parameter [string!], eliminating dependency on global
   variable access while maintaining proper encapsulation principles.

2. Inaccurate Global State Tracking:
   Problem: The overall test result indicator was displaying incorrect
   status due to local variable shadowing within individual test functions.
   Each function created its own local binding for 'all-tests-passed',
   preventing proper accumulation of test results at the global scope.

   Resolution: Restructured the result collection mechanism to use explicit
   return values from test functions. Implemented a centralized result
   aggregation system that collects Boolean outcomes from all test
   executions and performs accurate overall status determination through
   iterative evaluation of the collected results.

3. String Manipulation Logic Error:
   Problem: The tick character insertion test was failing due to incorrect
   sequence of string operations. The original approach using sequential
   'insert' and 'append' operations on the same string reference produced
   unexpected results due to Rebol's position-based string manipulation
   behavior.

   Resolution: Replaced position-dependent string operations with
   straightforward concatenation using 'rejoin'. This approach eliminates
   positioning complexities and provides predictable string construction
   behavior while maintaining the intended functionality of wrapping the
   source string with single quote characters.

ARCHITECTURAL IMPROVEMENTS:

The refactored implementation demonstrates proper adherence to Rebol 3 Oldes
Branch development standards, including consistent use of the 'function'
constructor for automatic local variable management, explicit parameter
typing for enhanced code clarity and the elimination of global state
dependencies within individual test functions.

These modifications ensure reliable script execution, accurate result
reporting, and maintainable code structure while preserving the educational
value of the string manipulation examples.

;; Helper function to validate and display results:
validate: function [
    description [string!] "Description of the test"
    input [any-type!] "Input value or values"
    actual [any-type!] "Actual result"
    expected [any-type!] "Expected result"

    result: either equal? actual expected ["✅ PASSED"] ["❌ FAILED"]
    print rejoin ["---[" description "]---"]
    print ["Input:    " mold input]
