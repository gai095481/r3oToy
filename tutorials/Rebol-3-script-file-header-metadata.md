The `system/script/header` object has several standard fields that are `none!` when not explicitly defined in the script's `REBOL [...]` block.

```

```

These "missing" fields are not errors; they are reserved placeholders for structured, machine-readable metadata that enables more advanced script management, dependency handling and security. 
Using them correctly elevates a script from a simple file to a well-behaved component in a larger system.

Here is an explanation of each of the missing fields, their common uses, and what their values typically look like.

---

### **1. The `name` Field**

*   **Purpose:** To provide a simple, machine-readable, symbolic name for the script, often when it's intended to be used as a library or module. This is distinct from the human-readable `Title`.
*   **Common Datatype:** `word!`
*   **Usage and Example:** The `name` is used by module loaders or package managers to identify a script without having to parse a more complex string. It should be a single, valid word.

    ```rebol
    REBOL [
        Name: 'My-HTTP-Library
        Title: "My Awesome HTTP Library for Rebol"
        ...
    ]
    ```
    A management tool could then refer to this script simply as `'My-HTTP-Library`.

### **2. The `type` Field**

*   **Purpose:** To classify the script's primary function.
*   **Common Datatype:** `word!`
*   **Usage and Example:** This allows development tools or operating environments to know how to treat the file. Common types include:
    *   `'Module` or `'Library`: A script providing functions for other scripts to use.
    *   `'App`: A standalone, user-facing application.
    *   `'Test`: A script designed to test another module.
    *   `'Driver`: Code for interfacing with hardware or system services.

    ```rebol
    REBOL [
        Type: 'App
        Title: "My Cool GUI Application"
        ...
    ]
    ```

### **3. The `needs` Field**

*   **Purpose:** A powerful metadata field to declare the required dependencies of other scripts or modules for this script to function correctly.  The script fails if the dependencies are not met.
*   **Common Datatype:** `block!`
*   **Usage and Example:** The block usually contains `file!` values for script dependencies or `tuple!` values for interpreter version requirements. A sophisticated loader can read this block, load the dependencies first, and then execute the script.

    ```rebol
    REBOL [
        Title: "My Application"
        ;; This script needs Rebol 2.7.8 or higher, and two libraries
        Needs: [2.7.8 %database-lib.r %ui-toolkit.r]
        ...
    ]
    ```

### **4. The `options` Field**

*   **Purpose:** To specify special flags that modify the Rebol interpreter's behavior *for this script only*.
*   **Common Datatype:** `block!` of `word!`s.
*   **Usage and Example:** These options control security, debugging, and other runtime features.
    *   `'secure`: The most common option. It puts the script into a security "sandbox," preventing it from accessing files or the network.
    *   `'no-debug`: Disables certain debugging features.
    *   `'trace`: Enables function call tracing for debugging.
    *   `'quiet`: Suppresses the Rebol startup banner.

    ```rebol
    REBOL [
        Title: "Secure Data Parser"
        ;; This script will run in a sandbox and will not print the startup banner
        Options: [secure quiet]
        ...
    ]
    ```

### **5. The `checksum` Field**

*   **Purpose:** To store a checksum of the file, allowing a loader to verify its integrity and ensure it hasn't been corrupted or tampered with.
*   **Common Datatype:** `binary!`
*   **Usage and Example:** This value is almost always generated by a build tool, not written manually. The tool calculates the checksum of the script file (e.g., using SHA1) and then writes the result back into the header.

    ```rebol
    REBOL [
        Title: "My Verified Library"
        ;; This checksum would be generated by a build script
        Checksum: #{A1B2C3D4E5F6...}
        ...
    ]
    ```

In summary, these fields provide a formal contract between the script and its environment, enabling dependency management, security sandboxing
and integrity verificationâ€”all capabilities that are essential for building large, robust applications.
