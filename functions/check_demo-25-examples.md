### Project Name
Rebol 3 Oldes `check` Function Demo & Guide

### Purpose
To provide a comprehensive guide and practical examples for the Rebol 3 Oldes `check` function, primarily for educational purposes aimed at novice programmers.  The script demonstrates its use in debugging and validating the integrity of series data structures.

### Core Features (of the demo script)
The `check_demo-25-examples.r3` script is characterized by the following features:
- **Detailed Introduction:** An initial explanation of the `check` function, covering its purpose, syntax and important usage notes for beginners.
- **Reusable Helper Function:** A central `validate-series` function that standardizes `series` validation across all examples, providing consistent output formatting, proper error handling, optional custom formatting and support for additional operations after validation.
- **25 Distinct Examples:** Each example is encapsulated in its own Rebol functio` with comprehensive documentation including purpose, parameters, return values and potential errors.  These examples demonstrate `check` with a wide array of scenarios, including:
    - Basic `series` types: `string!`, `block!` and `binary!`.
    - Boundary conditions like empty and very large `series`.
    - Complex structures such as nested blocks.
    - `series!` that have undergone modifications (e.g., `append`, `insert`, `remove`).
    - Various Rebol datatypes converted to strings for checking, like `path!`, `url!` and `email!`.
    - Multi-line `string!` data.
    - Blocks containing a mix of different datatypes.
    - The results of common operations like `split` (in `parse` context), `copy`, `skip`, `reverse` and `sort`.
    - Enhanced handling and checking of Unicode `string!` content, with proper fallback mechanisms.
- **Contextual Usage:** Demonstrations of `check` within error handling blocks (`try/with`), and as a pre-emptive measure before critical operations.
- **Performance Insight:** Includes a performance test with proper error handling and more efficient `block!` creation.
- **Modular Design:** The code uses the `validate-series` helper to make the examples more maintainable while preserving all functionality.
- **Enhanced Error Handling:** Consistent error handling throughout all examples, with proper fallback mechanisms where appropriate.
- **Output Clarity:** The script's output includes descriptions of the actions being performed and clearly shows the data being validated by `check`, with consistent formatting and clear success/failure indicators.
- **Improved Documentation:** Each example in the `.r3` script includes detailed section headers explaining its purpose and key concepts, making the guide more valuable as a learning resource.
