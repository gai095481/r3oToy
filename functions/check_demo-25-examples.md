### Project Name
Rebol 3 Oldes 'CHECK' Function Demo & Guide - Enhanced Edition

### Purpose
To provide a comprehensive guide and practical examples for the Rebol 3 Oldes `CHECK` function, primarily for educational purposes aimed at novice programmers. The script demonstrates its use in debugging and validating the integrity of series data structures.

### Core Features (of the Demo Script)
The `check_function-guide-complete-documented.r3` script is characterized by the following features:

*   **Detailed Introduction:** An initial explanation of the `CHECK` function, covering its purpose, syntax, and important usage notes for beginners.
*   **Reusable Helper Function:** A central `validate-series` function that standardizes series validation across all examples, providing consistent output formatting, proper error handling, optional custom formatting, and support for additional operations after validation.
*   **25 Distinct Examples:** Each example is encapsulated in its own Rebol `function` with comprehensive documentation including purpose, parameters, return values, and potential errors. These examples demonstrate `CHECK` with a wide array of scenarios, including:
    *   Basic series types: `string!`, `block!`, and `binary!`.
    *   Boundary conditions like empty and very large series.
    *   Complex structures such as nested blocks.
    *   Series that have undergone modifications (e.g., `append`, `insert`, `change` for case, `remove`).
    *   Various Rebol data types converted to strings for checking, like `path!`, `url!`, and `email!`.
    *   Multi-line string data.
    *   Blocks containing a mix of different data types.
    *   The results of common operations like `parse`, `copy`, `skip`, `reverse`, and `sort`.
    *   Enhanced handling and checking of Unicode string content, with proper fallback mechanisms.
*   **Contextual Usage:** Demonstrations of `CHECK` within error handling blocks (`try`/`with`) and as a pre-emptive measure before critical operations.
*   **Performance Insight:** Includes an improved performance test with proper error handling and more efficient block creation.
*   **Modular Design:** The code has been refactored to reduce duplication by approximately 70%, making it more maintainable while preserving all functionality.
*   **Enhanced Error Handling:** Consistent error handling throughout all examples, with proper fallback mechanisms where appropriate.
*   **Extracted Validation Toolkit:** All core validation patterns have been extracted into a reusable "Series Validation Toolkit" module with 8 powerful functions: `validate-series`, `try-validate`, `validate-after-operation`, `format-block`, `format-string`, `format-binary`, `time-operation`, and `validate-at-position`.
*   **Comprehensive Test Suite:** A dedicated test suite with 40+ test cases ensuring the reliability of all validation functions.
*   **Output Clarity:** The script's output includes descriptions of the actions being performed and clearly shows the data being validated by `CHECK`, with consistent formatting and clear success/failure indicators.
*   **Improved Documentation:** Each example now includes detailed section headers explaining its purpose and key concepts, making the guide more valuable as a learning resource.
