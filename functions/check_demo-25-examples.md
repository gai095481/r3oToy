### Project Name
Rebol 3 Oldes 'CHECK' Function Demo & Guide.

### Purpose
To provide a comprehensive guide and practical examples for the Rebol 3 Oldes `CHECK` function, primarily for educational purposes aimed at novice programmers. The script demonstrates its use in debugging and validating the integrity of series data structures.

### Core Features (of the Demo Script)
The `check_demo-25-examples.r3` script is characterized by the following features:
*   **Detailed Introduction:** An initial explanation of the `CHECK` function, covering its purpose, syntax, and important usage notes for beginners.
*   **25 Distinct Examples:** Each example is encapsulated in its own Rebol `function` for clarity and modularity. These examples demonstrate `CHECK` with a wide array of scenarios, including:
    *   Basic series types: `string!`, `block!`, and `binary!`.
    *   Boundary conditions like empty and very large series.
    *   Complex structures such as nested blocks.
    *   Series that have undergone modifications (e.g., `append`, `insert`, `change` for case, `remove`).
    *   Various Rebol data types converted to strings for checking, like `path!`, `url!`, and `email!`.
    *   Multi-line string data.
    *   Blocks containing a mix of different data types.
    *   The results of common operations like `parse`, `copy`, `skip`, `reverse`, and `sort`.
    *   Basic handling and checking of Unicode string content, including simple error trapping.
*   **Contextual Usage:** Demonstrations of `CHECK` within error handling blocks (`try`/`catch`) and as a pre-emptive measure before critical operations.
*   **Performance Insight:** Includes a basic test to give an idea of `CHECK`'s performance characteristics.
*   **Concluding Summary:** Provides best practices for using `CHECK` and highlights common mistakes to avoid.
*   **Output Clarity:** The script's output includes descriptions of the actions being performed and clearly shows the data being validated by `CHECK`.
