### I. Overview

The `random` function in Rebol 3 (Oldes branch), is a highly versatile tool for generating random values and shuffling series.  It's designed to preserve the datatype of its input and offers several refinements for specialized behaviors, including reproducibility, cryptographic security and non-modifying selection from series.  Comprehensive diagnostic testing confirms its stability and adherence to documented behaviors.

### II. Core Behavior by Datatype

The `random` function's behavior is dependent on the datatype of its input value.

#### Integer Values

* ​**Range**​: Returns a random integer from 1 to N (inclusive).
* ​**Special Cases**​:
  - `random 0` always returns 0.
  - `random 1` always returns 1.
  - `random -5` returns a random integer from -5 to 0 (inclusive).
* ​**Example**​: `random 10` returns a value between 1 and 10.
  `random 100` returns a value between 1 and 100.

#### Decimal Values (floating point)

* ​**Range**​: Returns a random decimal from 0.0 to N (exclusive of the upper bound).
* ​**Precision**​: Maintains decimal precision.
  
  - ​**Example**​: `random 1.0` returns a value from 0.0 to 0.999999...
    `random 10.5` returns a value from 0.0 to 10.499999...

#### ​Series (blocks, strings, vectors, binary, etc.)​

- ​**Behavior**​: Shuffle the series **in-place** and return the same series reference.
  This means the original series is permanently modified in place (mutable).
- ​**Empty Series**​: Returns the same empty series unchanged.
- ​**Important**​: The original series is permanently modified.
  A copy can be made prior to preserve the original: `shuffled: random copy original-data`.

#### Time and Date Values​

* ​**Time**​: Return a random time between 0:00:00 and the specified time.
* ​**Date**​: Return a random date between the **system epoch** and the specified date.
  - ​**Example**​: `random 12:00:00` returns a random time up to 12:00:00.

### III. Function Refinements

#### Modify the behavior of the `random` function.

* ​`/seed` - Reproducible Random Sequences​:
  - Set the random number generator seed to enable reproducible results.
  - It only accepts integer seeds. `random/seed none` produces an error.
  - ​**Use Case**​: Ideal for reproducible testing where the test data will always be the same sequence if the same seed is used.
* ​`/secure` - Cryptographically Secure Random​
  - Generates cryptographically secure random numbers, suitable for security applications.
  - ​**Use Case**​: Recommended for "Secure Token Generation".
* ​`/only` - Pick Without Modification​
  - Selects a random element from a series *without* modifying the original series.
  - If applied to an empty series, it returns `none`.
  - Example**​: `random/only fruits` returns one element (e.g., 'banana),
    while `fruits` remains `[apple banana cherry]`.
* ​**Combining Refinements**​
  - Refinements can be combined, such as `random/secure/only` to select a secure random element from a series without modifying it.

### IV. Common Pitfalls and Solutions

#### Several common nuances arise when using `random`

##### Series Modification (mutable)

* ​**Caution**​: `random` modifies series in-place, which might lead to unintended data loss if not anticipated.
* ​**Solution**​: Copy the original data if the original series needs to be preserved before calling `random`.

##### Unsupported Datatypes

* ​**Caution**​: random is not universally applicable; attempting to use it with unsupported datatypes such as `money!` or `none!` results in errors.
* ​**Solution**​: "Only use supported datatypes (integer, decimal, series, time, date)."

##### Range Misunderstanding

* ​**Caution**​: The range behavior differs between integer and decimal inputs.  Integers are 1 to N (inclusive), while decimals are 0.0 to N (exclusive of the upper bound).
* ​**Solution**​: Be mindful of these distinctions when defining ranges.

##### Empty Series with `/only`

* ​**Caution**​: `random/only` on an empty series returns `none` causing subsequent errors if not handled properly.
* ​**Solution**​: Use checks for the `none` result after using `random/only` with potentially empty series.  A `safe-random-pick` function is provided as an example.

### V. Best Practices

Adhering to these best practices will help ensure effective and error-free use of the random function:

1. **Always use copy before shuffling** when you need to preserve the original series.
2. **Handle empty series** when using `/only` refinement.
3. **Use` /secure` for cryptographic applications** when security matters.
4. **Set seeds consistently** for reproducible testing scenarios.
5. **Validate datatypes** before calling `random` on user input.
6. **Remember range differences** between integers (1-N), and decimals (0.0-N).
7. Consider implementing an "Error Handling Pattern" such as `safe-random` to gracefully manage unsupported datatype errors.

### VI. Testing and Stability

Extensive diagnostic probing, comprising 44 tests, confirms the robust and stable behavior of the random function across its various modes and edge cases:
