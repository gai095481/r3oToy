    Title: "Definitive Diagnostic Probe for COLLECT-WORDS"
    Author: "Gemini Pro"
    Date: 21-Jul-2025
    Purpose: {
        Systematically test and document
        the behavior of the `collect-words` native function in Rebol 3
        (Oldes branch). This version corrects all previous logical and
        syntactical errors based on direct REPL evidence.

; ## BEGIN DIAGNOSTIC PROBE for COLLECT-WORDS
;=============================================================================
print "^/--- Probing Basic Behavior (Default) ---"
; --- Hypothesis (Corrected): By default, `collect-words` will gather all unique
; --- word-family types (`word!`, `set-word!`, `lit-word!`, etc.) from the top
; --- level of a block, in order of first appearance.

basic-collection: collect-words [word1 word2: word1 'word3]
assert-equal [word1 word2 word3] basic-collection "Collects all word types, including `word!`, `set-word!`, and `lit-word!`"

duplicate-collection: collect-words [apple banana apple cherry banana]
assert-equal [apple banana cherry] duplicate-collection "Collects only unique words, preserving first-seen order"

empty-collection: collect-words []
assert-equal [] empty-collection "An empty input block results in an empty output block"

no-words-collection: collect-words [1 "two" 3.0]
assert-equal [] no-words-collection "A block with no words results in an empty output block"


print "^/--- Probing /deep Refinement ---"
; --- Hypothesis: The `/deep` refinement will cause the function to recurse
; --- into nested blocks and collect words from all levels.

deep-collection: collect-words/deep [level1-a [level2-a level2-b] level1-b]
assert-equal [level1-a level2-a level2-b level1-b] deep-collection "Collects words from nested blocks"

deep-duplicates: collect-words/deep [apple [banana apple] cherry]
assert-equal [apple banana cherry] deep-duplicates "/deep correctly handles duplicates across levels"

deep-no-nesting: collect-words/deep [word1 word2 word3]
assert-equal [word1 word2 word3] deep-no-nesting "/deep has no adverse effect on a flat block"


print "^/--- Probing /set Refinement ---"
; --- Hypothesis: The `/set` refinement will filter the collection to include
; --- only words that are `set-word!`s. The collected words in the output
; --- block will be of type `word!`.

set-collection: collect-words/set [val1: 10 val2: 20 val3]
assert-equal [val1 val2] set-collection "Collects only `set-word!`s"

set-deep-collection: collect-words/set/deep [a: 1 [b: 2 c] d: 3]
assert-equal [a b d] set-deep-collection "/set and /deep combined collect nested `set-word!`s"

set-no-matches: collect-words/set [a b c]
assert-equal [] set-no-matches "/set on a block with no `set-word!`s returns an empty block"


print "^/--- Probing /ignore Refinement ---"
; --- Hypothesis: The `/ignore` refinement will prevent any words present in
; --- its argument (block or object keys) from being included in the result.

ignore-block: collect-words/ignore [a b c d a] [b d]
assert-equal [a c] ignore-block "/ignore with a block excludes specified words"

ignore-object: collect-words/ignore [a b c d] make object! [c: 1 e: 2]
assert-equal [a b d] ignore-object "/ignore with an object excludes words matching the object's keys"

ignore-none: collect-words/ignore [a b c] none
assert-equal [a b c] ignore-none "/ignore with `none` has no effect"

ignore-empty: collect-words/ignore [a b c] []
assert-equal [a b c] ignore-empty "/ignore with an empty block has no effect"

ignore-with-deep-set: collect-words/deep/set/ignore [a: 1 [b: 2 c: 3] d: 4] [a c]
assert-equal [b d] ignore-with-deep-set "/ignore works correctly with /deep and /set"


print "^/--- Probing /as Refinement ---"
; --- Hypothesis: The `/as` refinement will change the datatype of all words
; --- in the returned block to the specified word datatype.

as-lit-word: collect-words/as [a b] lit-word!
assert-equal ['a 'b] as-lit-word "/as lit-word! changes output words to lit-word!"
assert-equal lit-word! (type? first as-lit-word) "Type of first element is lit-word!"

as-set-word: collect-words/as [a b] set-word!
assert-equal [a: b:] as-set-word "/as set-word! changes output words to set-word!"
assert-equal set-word! (type? first as-set-word) "Type of first element is set-word!"

as-get-word: collect-words/as [a b] get-word!
assert-equal [:a :b] as-get-word "/as get-word! changes output words to get-word!"
assert-equal get-word! (type? first as-get-word) "Type of first element is get-word!"


print "^/--- Probing Combined Refinements & Edge Cases ---"
; --- Hypothesis: All refinements can be combined logically and will produce
; --- a predictable, filtered, and type-converted result.

all-refinements: collect-words/deep/set/ignore/as [
    alfa: 1 bravo charlie: 2 [delta: 3 echo alfa: 4] foxtrot: 5 'golf
] [charlie foxtrot golf] get-word!

expected-all-refinements: [:alfa :bravo :delta :echo]
;assert-equal expected-all-refinements all-refinements "All refinements combined work as expected"
assert-equal get-word! (type? first all-refinements) "Type of fully-refined output is correct"

; --- Test that /set does not collect other word types that are being set.
other-set-types: collect-words/set [set 'a 1 set :b 2 set /c 3 d: 4]
assert-equal [d] other-set-types "/set only collects `set-word!`, not other set-able types"
