What "reduce" means in the context of `rejoin` and how it works step by step.

### What Does *Reduce* Mean?

In Rebol, **reduce** means to **evaluate** expressions and return their results.
Think of it as evaluating, resolving or computing values that might be stored as code or references.

### The `rejoin` Two-Step Process

The`rejoin` function does exactly two things:

1. **REDUCE the block** - Evaluate any expressions to get their actual values.
2. **JOIN the results** - Convert everything to strings and concatenate them.

### Understanding `reduce` with Examples

Notice the difference between a block before and after reduction / evaluation:

```rebol
;; Before reduction - these are just symbols/expressions:
my-block: [2 + 3  "Hello"  length? "test"  now/date]

;; After reduction - expressions are evaluated:
reduced-block: reduce my-block
;; Result would be: [5 "Hello" 4 7-Jul-2025]
```

### How It Works Inside `rejoin`

Here's what happens internally when you call `rejoin`:

```rebol
;; Your original block might contain expressions:
input: ["Result: " 2 + 3 " items"]

;; Step 1: `reduce` evaluates the expressions:
;; [2 + 3] becomes [5]
reduced: reduce input  ;; ["Result: " 5 " items"]

;; Step 2: `join` converts everything to strings and concatenates it:
;; Final result: "Result: 5 items"
```

### Practical Examples

**Example 1:** Simple strings (no expressions to reduce).

```rebol
block1: ["apple" "banana" "pear"]
;; `reduce` has no effect - these are already literal values.
;; `rejoin` just joins them: "applebananapear".
```

**Example 3:** Mixed datatypes.

```rebol
block3: ["100" 200 true $20.50]
;; `reduce` evaluates: 200 stays 200, true stays true, $20.50 stays $20.50.
;; `rejoin` converts each to string and joins: "100200true$20.50".
```

**A more complex example:**

```rebol
name: "Alice"
age: 25
message-block: ["Hello " name ", you are " age " years old"]

;; Without `rejoin`, you'd have expressions:
print message-block  ;; ["Hello " name ", you are " age " years old"]

;; With `rejoin`, expressions get reduced (evaluated), then joined
print rejoin message-block  ;; "Hello Alice, you are 25 years old"
```

### Why `reduce` Matters

The "reduce" step is crucial because it allows you to:

* **Mix literal values with variables** in the same block.
* **Include calculations** that get computed at runtime.
* **Build dynamic strings** from various data sources.

Without the reduce step, `rejoin` would just join the literal symbols rather than their evaluated values, which wouldn't be very useful for building dynamic content.

In essence, `reduce` transforms your block from *instructions* into *results*  before the joining happens.
