## Key Insights from Diagnostic Testing

- Date formatting: Uses DD-Mon-YYYY format instead of ISO format

- Special values: none forms to "none" string, not empty string

- Set-words: Form without trailing colon (e.g., "set-word" not "set-word:")

- Path representation: Outputs molded representation instead of simple path string

### Complex types:

- Tuples form to their element count

- Objects form to empty string

- Maps form to key-value pairs with newline separation

- Functions form to constructor syntax

- String handling: Preserves newlines in strings

- Binary data: Outputs uppercase hexadecimal representation

This script provides comprehensive, verified documentation of form's behavior in REBOL/Bulk 3.19.0. All 43 tests pass successfully,
confirming the function's stability and documenting its precise behavior across all major data types and edge cases.
