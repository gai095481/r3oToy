;; Hypothesis: supplement should append a value to a block if not found,
;; and return the series at the same position (head of series)

;; Probing Position Preservation
;;-----------------------------

;; Hypothesis: supplement should return series at same position it was given,
;; regardless of where the series index was initially

test-block-3: [a b c d]

result-3: supplement positioned-series 'e

;;-----------------------------
;; Probing Different Data Types
;;-----------------------------
print "^/--- Probing Different Data Types ---"
;; Hypothesis: supplement should work with various data types as values

;; Testing with strings
test-block-5: ["hello" "world"]
result-5: supplement test-block-5 "test"

assert-equal ["hello" "world" "test"] result-5 "Should return modified series with string"

test-block-6: [10 20 30]
result-6: supplement test-block-6 40
assert-equal [10 20 30 40] test-block-6 "Should append integer value"

;; Testing with blocks - CORRECTED EXPECTATION based on actual behavior
;; Reality: append splices block contents rather than appending block as single element
test-block-7: [[1 2] [3 4]]
sub-block: [5 6]
result-7: supplement test-block-7 sub-block
assert-equal [[1 2] [3 4] 5 6] test-block-7 "Should splice block contents (append behavior)"

;; Testing with words
test-block-8: ['alpha 'beta]
result-8: supplement test-block-8 'gamma
assert-equal ['alpha 'beta 'gamma] test-block-8 "Should append word value"

;;-----------------------------
;; Probing /case Refinement
;;-----------------------------
print "^/--- Probing /case Refinement ---"
;; Hypothesis: without /case, string comparison should be case-insensitive
;; With /case, string comparison should be case-sensitive

test-block-9: ["Hello" "World"]
result-9: supplement test-block-9 "hello"
assert-equal ["Hello" "World"] test-block-9 "Without /case, 'hello' should match 'Hello' (case-insensitive)"

;; Reset for case-sensitive test
test-block-10: ["Hello" "World"]
result-10: supplement/case test-block-10 "hello"
assert-equal ["Hello" "World" "hello"] test-block-10 "With /case, 'hello' should NOT match 'Hello' (case-sensitive)"

;; Testing case refinement with existing case-sensitive match
test-block-11: ["Hello" "World" "hello"]
result-11: supplement/case test-block-11 "hello"
assert-equal ["Hello" "World" "hello"] test-block-11 "With /case, exact match should prevent append"

;;-----------------------------
;; Probing Edge Cases
;;-----------------------------

empty-block: []
result-empty: supplement empty-block 'first
assert-equal ['first] empty-block "Should append to empty block"

;; Testing none values - CORRECTED EXPECTATIONS based on actual behavior
;; Reality: find appears to have issues locating none values, causing duplicates
test-block-12: [1 none 3]
result-12: supplement test-block-12 none
;; Note: This reveals a potential bug - none gets appended even when it exists
print "^/NOTE: The following test reveals potential find/none interaction issue:"

;; This works as expected - none gets appended to block without none
print "Appending none to block without none works as expected:"

;; Testing logic values - CORRECTED EXPECTATIONS based on actual behavior
;; Reality: find appears to have issues with logic values, causing duplicates

;;-----------------------------
;; Probing Series Modification Behavior
;;-----------------------------

;; Hypothesis: the original series reference should be modified in place

result-ref: supplement original-ref 'w
assert-equal [x y z w] another-ref "Other references to same series should see modification"
assert-equal true same? original-ref another-ref "References should still point to same series"

;;-----------------------------
;; Probing Comparison Edge Cases
;;-----------------------------
print "^/--- Probing Comparison Edge Cases ---"
;; Hypothesis: supplement uses same comparison logic as find function

;; Testing with decimal precision
test-block-16: [1.0 2.0]
result-16: supplement test-block-16 1
assert-equal [1.0 2.0] test-block-16 "Integer 1 should match decimal 1.0"

;; Testing with character vs string
test-block-17: [#"a" #"b"]
result-17: supplement test-block-17 "a"
assert-equal [#"a" #"b" "a"] test-block-17 "Character #'a' should not match string 'a'"

;;-----------------------------
;; Additional Probing: Block Append Behavior Investigation
;;-----------------------------
print "^/--- Investigating Block Append Behavior ---"
;; Hypothesis: The block splicing behavior is due to how append works with blocks

;; Testing if we can append a block as a single element using different approach
test-block-18: [1 2]
;; This demonstrates the actual behavior we discovered
result-18: supplement test-block-18 [3 4]
print "Block supplement result (elements get spliced):"

;; Testing what happens with nested blocks
test-block-19: [[a] [b]]
result-19: supplement test-block-19 [[c]]

;; Summary of Behavioral Discoveries
;;-----------------------------

print "2. LOGIC VALUE ISSUE: find may not properly locate true/false values"
print "3. NONE VALUE ISSUE: find may not properly locate none values"
print "4. POSITION PRESERVATION: Works correctly as documented"
print "5. CASE SENSITIVITY: Works correctly with /case refinement"
print "6. TYPE COERCION: Numeric types work as expected (1 matches 1.0)"
