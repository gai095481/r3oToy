Through the process of probing `ajoin` behavior in Rebol 3 Oldes,
DeepSeek R1 encountered several important lessons and nuanced behaviors Rebol developers should be aware of.
This is a preliminary assessment needing review by a person.

Here are the key insights:

### Lessons Learned:
1. **REPL Evidence Over Assumptions**:
   - Never trust documentation or intuition alone; actual REPL behavior often differs.
   - Multiple iterations were needed to align tests with real-world behavior.
   - Example: Assumed tags would reduce to text content, but they retain angle brackets.

2. **Unset Values are Problematic**:
   - Directly handling unset values in test blocks causes runtime errors.
   - Workaround: Use `get/any` and wrapper functions, but even these proved unreliable.
   - Ultimately avoided unset testing as too unstable for diagnostic scripts.

3. **Type Coercion Nuances**:
   - Mixed file/string inputs sometimes return file! type unexpectedly.
   - Objects use `form` (short representation) instead of `mold`.
   - Block delimiters need explicit reduction: `[space]` vs `reduce [space]` differ.

4. **Refinement Interactions**:
   - Refinement order doesn't matter (`/all/with` ≡ `/with/all`).
   - `/all` converts none → "none" but unset → "" (empty string).
   - Delimiters apply even with empty elements when using `/all`.

### Key Difficulties Overcome:
1. **Inconsistent Nested Block Handling**:
   - `ajoin [["a" "b"] ["c"]]` → "a bc" (space-separated).
   - But `ajoin ["a" ["b" "c"] "d"]` → "ab cd" (inconsistent spacing).
   - Resolution: Created separate test cases for each nesting pattern.

2. **File Path Special Cases**:
   - Mixed file/string inputs sometimes return file!, sometimes string.
   - Depends on whether the result forms a valid path.
   - Added type checks to verify both value and datatype.

3. **Block Delimiter Quirks**:
   - `ajoin/with ["x" "y"] [space]` → "xspacey" (literal).
   - `ajoin/with ["x" "y"] reduce [space]` → "x y" (evaluated).
   - Required separate tests for evaluated vs unevaluated blocks.

4. **Empty Element Handling**:
   - Empty strings ("") are preserved while none are ignored.
   - `ajoin ["a" "" "b"]` → "ab" but positions matter.
   - Added specific tests for empty string positioning.

### Critical Nuances and Quirks for Rebol Programmers:
1. **File Path Magic Behavior**:
   ```rebol
   ajoin [%home/user/ "file.txt"]   → %home/user/file.txt (file!)
   ajoin ["home" %/user %file.txt] → "home/userfile.txt" (string!)
   ```
   - Returns file! only when building valid paths from file! components.

2. **Object Formation Shortcut**:
   ```rebol
   obj: make object! [a: 1]
   ajoin [obj]  → "a: 1"   ; Short form (form) instead of full mold
   ```

3. **None vs Empty String**:
   ```rebol
   ajoin ["a" none "b"]     → "ab"     ; None disappears
   ajoin ["a" "" "b"]       → "ab"     ; Empty string disappears
   ajoin/with/all ["a" none "" "b"] "-" → "a-none--b" ; All visible
   ```

4. **Block Delimiter Evaluation**:
   ```rebol
   ajoin/with ["x" "y"] [space]     → "xspacey"   ; Literal
   ajoin/with ["x" "y"] reduce [space] → "x y"    ; Evaluated
   ```

5. **Nested Block Inconsistency**:
   ```rebol
   ajoin [["a" "b"] ["c"]]  → "a bc"   ; Space in nested block
   ajoin ["a" ["b" "c"] "d"] → "ab cd"  ; Different spacing
   ```

### Recommendations for Rebol Developers:
1. **Avoid Mixing Types** with file! - results are unpredictable.
2. **Explicitly Reduce Blocks** when using as delimiters.
3. **Pre-Process None Values** - don't rely on /all if you need consistent behavior.
4. **Test Edge Cases** thoroughly - especially around empty values.
5. **Verify Return Types** - file! results might surprise you.
6. **Use form vs mold** intentionally when working with objects.

The most valuable lesson was that Rebol's "do what I mean" philosophy can lead to subtle, context-dependent behaviors.
These quirks make Rebol powerful for domain-specific tasks but require thorough verification for reliable code.
The complete diagnostic script now serves as "living documentation" capturing these nuances through executable examples.
