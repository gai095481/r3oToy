## Practical Data Processing Use Cases for `swap`

### 1. Data Cleansing (Error Correction)

```rebol
;; Swap misplaced values in parallel datasets:
temperature: [23.5 25.1 17.8 22.3]
humidity: [45 52 78 41]
swap at temperature 3 at humidity 3  ;; Fix misaligned sensor readings.
```

### 2. Matrix Transposition

```rebol
;; Transpose matrix elements efficiently:
matrix: [[1 2 3] [4 5 6] [7 8 9]]
swap at matrix/1 2 at matrix/2 1  ;; Swap 2 and 4
```

### 3. In-Place Sorting Operations

```rebol
;; Bubble sort implementation:
data: [5 3 8 1 9]
until [
    swapped: false
    forall data [
        if (index? data) > 1 and (data/-1 > data/1) [
            swap back data data
            swapped: true
        ]
    ]
    not swapped
]
```

### 4. Data Stream Synchronization

```rebol
;; Align timestamps in sensor data streams:
gps-data: [t1 t2 t3 t4]
sensor-data: [s1 s2 s3 s4]
swap find gps-data t3 find sensor-data s2  ;; Correct misalignment.
```

### 5. Financial Data Rebalancing

```rebol
;; Rebalance portfolio allocations:
stocks: [100 200 150 300]
bonds: [50 75 60 80]
swap at stocks 2 at bonds 3  ;; Adjust asset classes.
```

### 6. Genetic Algorithm Operations

```rebol
;; Chromosome crossover in genetic algorithms:
parent1: [A B C D E F]
parent2: [1 2 3 4 5 6]
swap skip parent1 2 skip parent2 3  ;; Exchange gene segments.
```

### 7. Time-Series Data Adjustment

```rebol
;; Correct out-of-sequence data points:
timestamps: [2023-01-01 2023-01-03 2023-01-02]
swap at timestamps 2 at timestamps 3  ;; Fix date ordering
```

### 8. Buffer Management in Data Pipelines

```rebol
;; Swap processing buffers:
buffer-a: collect [repeat i 1000 [keep i]]
buffer-b: make block! 1000
swap buffer-a buffer-b  ;; Rotate buffers for parallel processing.
```

### 9. Statistical Normalization

```rebol
;; Swap outliers with median values:
dataset: [12 15 120 14 18]  ;; 120 is outlier.
medians: [13 14 13 14 15]
swap find dataset 120 find medians 3  ;; Replace outlier.
```

### 10. Columnar Data Transformation

```rebol
;; Reorder CSV columns during processing:
header: ["Name" "Age" "ID" "Department"]
swap find header "ID" find header "Age"  ;; Swap column positions.
```

### 11. In-Memory Database Operations

```rebol
;; Update record positions in NoSQL storage:
records: [
    [id: 1 name: "Alice"]
    [id: 2 name: "Bob"]
    [id: 3 name: "Charlie"]
]
swap find records [id: 2] find records [id: 3]  ;; Promote the record.
```

### 12. Machine Learning Feature Engineering

```rebol
;; Swap feature weights during model tuning:
weights: [0.2 0.8 0.5 0.1]
swap at weights 2 at weights 4  ;; Experiment with weight positions.
```

### 13. Text Processing (Anagram Detection)

```rebol
;; Generate word variations
word: "listen"
anagram: "silent"
swap at word 2 at anagram 3  ;; Transform between similar words.
```

### 14. Graph Processing

```rebol
;; Swap node connections in adjacency list:
graph: [
    A: [B C]
    B: [A D]
    C: [A E]
]
swap find graph/A 'B find graph/B 'D  ;; Rewire connections.
```

### 15. Real-time Data Window Processing

```rebol
;; Maintain a sliding data window:
window: make block! 5  ; [t-4 t-3 t-2 t-1 current]
new-data: next-data
swap window new-data  ;; Efficient window update.
```

## Key Advantages in Data Processing:

1. **Zero-Copy Operations**: Modifies data in-place without memory allocation.
2. **O(1) Complexity**: Constant-time execution regardless of data size.
3. **Type Safety**: Prevents mixed-type errors at runtime.
4. **Positional Precision**: Targets specific elements without full iteration.
5. **Idempotent Operations**: Safe for retry patterns in ETL pipelines.
6. **Minimal Memory Footprint**: Critical for big data processing.

## Pro Tip: Safe Swap Pattern

```rebol
safe-swap: funct [
    "Swap elements with position validation"
    a [series!] b [series!]
][
    if all [
        same? type? a type? b
        not tail? a 
        not tail? b
    ][swap a b]
]
```

These patterns leverage `swap`'s unique ability to perform surgical, in-place data modifications with minimal overhead; crucial for high-performance data processing systems.
