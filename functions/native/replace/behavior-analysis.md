The diagnostic probe script successfully validated all hypotheses about the `replace` function in Rebol 3 Oldes branch. All tests passed, confirming the function's behavior aligns with documented specifications and logical expectations. Below is a summary of key findings:

### **Key Validated Behaviors**

1. **Basic Behavior**
   
   - `replace` modifies the **first occurrence** of the search value in the target series.
   - Returns the modified target series.
   - No changes occur if the search value is not found (https://www.rebol.com/docs/core23/rebolcore-15.html).
2. **Refinements**
   
   - **`/all`**: Replaces **all occurrences** of the search value.
   - **`/case`**: Enables **case-sensitive matching** (default is case-insensitive).
   - **`/tail`**: Returns the target series **positioned after the last replacement** (or unchanged if no match).
   - Combined refinements (e.g., `/all/case/tail`) work logically together (https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/REBOL_Programming/replace).
3. **Data Type Handling**
   
   - **Blocks**: Supports replacement of single values, multi-element sequences, and nested structures.
   - **Binary**: Handles byte-level replacements correctly (after fixing invalid syntax `2#{02}` → `#{02}`).
   - **Type Conversion**: Automatically converts search values (e.g., integers or words) to match the target series type (e.g., strings).
4. **Edge Cases**
   
   - Empty targets (`""`, `[]`) remain unchanged.
   - Empty search values yield no replacements.
   - Self-referential replacements (e.g., replacing a string with itself) do not cause infinite loops.
5. **Advanced Features**
   
   - **Function-Based Replacement**: Functions execute once per replacement, enabling dynamic values (e.g., incremental counters).

### **Critical Observations**

- **Case Sensitivity**: The `/case` refinement strictly enforces exact character matching, while default behavior is case-insensitive.
- **Binary Precision**: Binary replacements respect byte values (e.g., `#{02}` → `#{04}`).
- **Efficiency**: Large replacements (e.g., substituting "small" with "much larger replacement") and multi-element block operations work without performance issues.
- **Consistency**: All refinements compose predictably (e.g., `/all/case/tail` behaves as the union of individual refinements).

### **Conclusion**

The `replace` function in Rebol 3 Oldes branch is robust, versatile, and adheres to its documented behavior. All hypotheses were confirmed by the test results:

- ✅ First-match-only vs. `/all` behavior.
- ✅ Case sensitivity control with `/case`.
- ✅ Tail positioning with `/tail`.
- ✅ Cross-type compatibility (string/block/binary).
- ✅ Dynamic replacement via functions.

This script serves as authoritative evidence of `replace`'s reliability in Rebol 3 environments.
