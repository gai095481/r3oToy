    Title: "MOLD Function Diagnostic Probe"
    Purpose: "Comprehensive testing and documentation tool for Rebol 3 Oldes mold native function"
    Author: "Claude 4 Sonnet"
    Date: 15-Jul-2025
    Version: 0.1.0
    Type: 'script
    Description: {
        This diagnostic probe systematically tests the `mold` function behavior across
        all supported data types, refinements (/only, /all, /flat, /part), and their
        combinations to generate empirical evidence of function behavior.

        Building upon the proven methodology from the last function diagnostic probe,
        this tool emphasizes comprehensive refinement testing and multi-line output
        handling for the unique complexity of mold function testing.

;; BASIC MOLD BEHAVIOR TESTS (NO REFINEMENTS)
;; =============================================================================
;; This section tests the core mold function behavior without any refinements
;; across all basic data types. Each test verifies that mold produces the
;; expected string representation for different value types.
;;
;; HYPOTHESIS: The mold function should produce consistent, readable string
;; representations for all basic Rebol data types that can be used to
;; reconstruct the original values. Each data type should have a predictable
;; molding pattern:
;;   • Integers and decimals: Direct numeric representation
;;   • Strings: Quoted representation with proper escaping
;;   • Characters: #"char" literal syntax
;;   • Logic values: "true" or "false" string representation
;;   • None: "none" string representation
;;   • Words: Quoted word syntax with appropriate prefixes/suffixes
;;
;; EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
;;   ✓ All basic data types mold to readable string representations
;;   ✓ Molded output can be used to reconstruct original values
;;   ✓ Special characters and edge cases are handled correctly
;;   ✓ No errors occur during basic molding operations
;;   ✓ Output format is consistent across similar data types

;;
;; HYPOTHESIS: Each mold refinement should have a specific, predictable effect
;; on the output format while maintaining the essential data content:
;;   • /only refinement: Should remove outer brackets from block content
;;   • /all refinement: Should use construction syntax for applicable types
;;   • /flat refinement: Should remove indentation from nested structures
;;   • /part refinement: Should truncate output at specified character limit
;;
;; EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
;;   ✓ /only refinement produces block content without outer brackets
;;   ✓ /all refinement uses construction syntax (make, to, etc.) where applicable
;;   ✓ /flat refinement produces single-line output for nested structures
;;   ✓ /part refinement truncates at exact character boundaries

;; =============================================================================
;; REFINEMENT COMBINATION TESTING
;; =============================================================================
;; This section tests combinations of mold refinements to verify they work
;; correctly together. Tests cover two-refinement, three-refinement, and
;; four-refinement combinations across representative data types.
;;
;; HYPOTHESIS: Mold refinements should combine logically and predictably,
;; with each refinement contributing its specific effect to the final output:
;;   • Two-refinement combinations: Effects should stack appropriately
;;   • Three-refinement combinations: All three effects should be present
;;   • Four-refinement combination: All refinements should work together
;;   • No conflicts or unexpected interactions between refinements
;;
;; EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
;;   ✓ /only + /flat: Block content without brackets or indentation
;;   ✓ /only + /part: Block content without brackets, truncated
;;   ✓ /all + /flat: Construction syntax without indentation
;;   ✓ /all + /part: Construction syntax, truncated
;;   ✓ /flat + /part: No indentation, truncated
;;   ✓ Three-refinement combinations preserve all individual effects
;;   ✓ Four-refinement combination (/only/all/flat/part) works correctly
;;   ✓ No refinement conflicts or unexpected behavior
;;   ✓ Output remains valid and reconstructible where applicable

;; =============================================================================
;; COMPREHENSIVE DATA TYPE COVERAGE TESTS
;; =============================================================================
;; This section provides comprehensive testing of all data types with key
;; refinements to verify consistent behavior across type categories and
;; document any type-specific refinement interactions.
;;
;; HYPOTHESIS: All Rebol data types should be moldable with consistent behavior
;; patterns within their type categories. Refinements should have predictable
;; effects based on the nature of each data type:
;;   • Basic types: Should work with /all and /part, /flat may have no effect
;;   • Series types: Should work with all refinements appropriately
;;   • Complex types: Should handle refinements based on their structure
;;   • Type-specific behaviors should be consistent and documented
;;
;; EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
;;   ✓ All basic data types mold successfully with key refinements
;;   ✓ All series types handle /only, /flat, and /part appropriately
;;   ✓ Complex types use construction syntax with /all where applicable
;;   ✓ Refinements that don't apply to certain types are handled gracefully
;;   ✓ Consistent behavior patterns within each type category
;;   ✓ No unexpected errors or inconsistencies across data types
;;   ✓ Type-specific refinement interactions are well-defined

;; EDGE CASE AND ERROR TESTING
;; =============================================================================
;; This section implements comprehensive edge case testing including empty values,
;; boundary conditions, circular references, and error conditions to verify
;; robust mold function behavior under extreme or unusual circumstances.
;;
;; HYPOTHESIS: The mold function should be robust and handle edge cases gracefully
;; without crashing or producing invalid output. Specific expectations:
;;   • Empty values: Should mold to appropriate empty representations
;;   • Boundary conditions: Should handle extreme values correctly
;;   • Circular references: Should detect and handle gracefully
;;   • Invalid inputs: Should produce appropriate error messages
;;   • Large/complex data: Should handle without memory issues
;;
;; EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
;;   ✓ Empty series mold to appropriate empty syntax ([], "", #{}, etc.)
;;   ✓ Boundary values (max/min integers, very long strings) handled correctly
;;   ✓ Circular references detected and handled without infinite loops
;;   ✓ Invalid /part limits produce appropriate error conditions
;;   ✓ Extremely nested structures handled within reasonable limits
;;   ✓ Large data sets processed without memory errors
;;   ✓ Error messages are clear and informative
;;   ✓ No crashes or undefined behavior under stress conditions

;; COMPLEX MULTI-LINE OUTPUT TESTING
;; =============================================================================
;; This section tests complex scenarios that produce multi-line mold output,
;; including nested objects, blocks with indentation, and refinement interactions
;; with multi-line content. Tests verify proper indentation handling and /part
;; refinement behavior with multi-line output truncation.
;;
;; HYPOTHESIS: Complex nested structures should produce properly formatted
;; multi-line output with consistent indentation and line handling. Refinements
;; should interact correctly with multi-line content:
;;   • Nested structures: Should use consistent indentation patterns
;;   • Multi-line strings: Should preserve line breaks and formatting
;;   • /flat refinement: Should remove indentation while preserving content
;;   • /part refinement: Should truncate multi-line output at character boundaries
;;   • Enhanced assert-equal: Should handle multi-line comparisons correctly
;;
;; EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
;;   ✓ Nested objects and blocks produce readable multi-line output
;;   ✓ Indentation is consistent and follows logical nesting levels
;;   ✓ Multi-line strings preserve original line break structure
;;   ✓ /flat refinement removes indentation without changing content
;;   ✓ /part refinement truncates multi-line output correctly
;;   ✓ Line-by-line comparison works for complex multi-line output
;;   ✓ Formatting differences are clearly identified in test failures
;;   ✓ Multi-line output remains valid and reconstructible
