### PROJECT SNAPSHOT: 2025-06-21

**COMPLETED THIS SESSION:**
*   **Developed `grab` function**: Created a robust, safe "super-getter" for Rebol `block!` and `map!` types.
*   **Implemented `grab` `/path` traversal**: Added logic to `grab` to recursively navigate nested data structures.
*   **Debugged `grab` extensively**: Solved numerous complex bugs related to Rebol's specific behaviors (the "Two Nones" problem, `word!` vs. `datatype!` returns, constructor evaluation) by using a "Try / Fallback" architecture.
*   **Developed `sling` function**: Designed and implemented a "super-setter" to modify data structures in place.
*   **Separated `sling` Concerns**: Refactored the `sling` project into two functions (`sling` as the path orchestrator, `set-in` as the single-level worker) after hitting a wall with recursive complexity. This strategy ultimately failed.
*   **Finalized `sling` Architecture**: Reverted to a single `sling` function after proving the two-function approach was flawed. Debugged the `/path` logic by discovering that using `grab` as a helper for a setter was incorrect due to its value-copying nature. Rolled back to a stable state.
*   **Documented Core Functions**: Created professional, "Missing Manual" style guides for native functions `pick`, `select`, and `find`, and a user guide for `grab`.

**KEY DECISIONS:**
*   **`grab` Architecture**: Decided to use a "Try / Fallback" pattern in the `block? data` branch to safely handle both literal values and unevaluated constructor expressions. This was the key breakthrough.
*   **`sling` Architecture**: After multiple failures, decided to **halt development on the `/path` logic** and roll back to the last stable version where only single-level and `/create` operations work. The recursive, in-place modification proved too complex and unstable with our current approach.
*   **Documentation Style**: Agreed on a professional, graduate-level technical writing style, eschewing the Oxford comma and `else` keyword, and using specific Markdown formatting.
*   **Keyword Style**: Decided on a nuanced keyword policy: default to lowercase but preserve capitalization for well-known acronyms (`QA`, `URL`, `ARM`, `arm`, etc.).

**OPEN ISSUES/BLOCKERS:**
*   **`sling` `/path` logic is unresolved**: The primary blocker is that all attempts to implement in-place modification for nested structures have failed. The function cannot correctly maintain a reference into the original data structure during traversal. This is the main outstanding technical challenge.

**NEXT STEPS:**
1.  **Re-evaluate `sling` `/path` Strategy**: The immediate next step is to devise a new, fundamentally different strategy to implement the `/path` logic for `sling`. The previous attempts have proven fruitless.
2.  **Gather More Evidence**: Before trying a new implementation, we must use the REPL to gather more hard evidence about how Rebol handles in-place modification of nested series. Specifically, we need to find a reliable "pointer" or "reference" manipulation pattern.
3.  **Implement Security Features**: Once `sling` is stable, implement the planned `/secure` refinement to make the pathing logic safe for external input.

**CONTEXT NOTES:**
*   **Coding Style**: Prefers explicit `return` statements for all code paths (the "Explicit Return Value Architecture" rule is critical). Abhors the `else` keyword. Prefers simple, original versions of test harnesses over complex ones.
*   **Development Style**: Insists on a methodical, evidence-based approach. Uses the REPL to validate assumptions about Rebol's behavior before writing code. Values comprehensive test suites and uses them to drive development and find bugs.
*   **Architecture**: We have learned that separating concerns is vital. The failed `sling` and `set-in` split was a good idea in principle, indicating that a more modular approach is needed for the complex `/path` logic.
