# Goal: Find Missing Square Bracket `]` in Rebol 3 Oldes Scripts

## Introduction

This report documents the exploration and rationale behind the chosen solution for identifying the location of syntax errors caused by
missing closing square bracket (`]`) in Rebol 3 Oldes scripts. It outlines the various methods investigated, their strengths, limitations
and the reasoning that led to the final implementation strategy.

## Methods Investigated

### 1. External Tools

#### a) `ast-grep`

*   **Concept:** Use a syntax tree-based search tool to analyze the code structure and identify unbalanced brackets.
*   **Outcome:** No readily available, accurate Tree-sitter grammar for Rebol 3 Oldes exists. Creating one is a complex task (Moderate to High difficulty) due to Rebol's flexible syntax and dialects.
*   **Decision:** Not a viable short-term solution.

#### b) `ripgrep` (`rg`)

*   **Concept:** Use a fast text search tool to find existing brackets or code patterns.
*   **Outcome:** Fundamentally incapable of detecting the *absence* of a character. Cannot automatically locate a *missing* bracket.
*   **Decision:** Unsuitable for the core task.

### 2. Script-Based Approaches

#### a) Report Opening Bracket Location (Initial Script)

*   **Concept:** Parse the file character by character, tracking bracket nesting levels. Report the line/column of the first opening bracket `[` that lacks a corresponding `]` before the end of the file. Provide code context.
*   **Implementation:** Rebol 3 script (`find-missing-bracket-approx.r3`).
*   **Strengths:**
    *   Accurately identifies the *scope* of the problem (the unclosed block).
    *   Provides useful context via code snippets.
    *   Self-contained, no external dependencies.
    *   Robustly handles strings and comments.
*   **Limitations:**
    *   Identifies the *start* of the unclosed block, not the *exact line* where the missing `]` should be inserted.
    *   User must manually scan the identified block to find the logical end.

#### b) Iterative Simplification / Reduction

*   **Concept:**
    1.  Preprocess the code to remove comments and the *content* of strings, preserving structure and whitespace.
    2.  Iteratively scan the simplified code.
    3.  Find *balanced* top-level `[...]` pairs.
    4.  Replace the *entire* balanced pair with a placeholder (e.g., `__BALANCED_BLOCK__`).
    5.  Repeat until no more balanced pairs can be found.
    6.  The remaining unmatched `[` in the final simplified string indicates the problematic block.
    7.  Map the position of this remaining `[` back to the original file.
*   **Implementation Attempts:**
    *   `find-missing-bracket-simplify.r3`: Initial attempt suffered from bugs in `position-map` construction (`append` vs `append/only`) and character increment logic, leading to incorrect mapping and misleading results.
    *   `find-missing-bracket-isolate.r3`: Correctly implemented the iterative removal logic but lacked robust position mapping to translate the final simplified position back to the original line.
*   **Strengths:**
    *   Conceptually sound for isolating structural problems.
    *   Effectively narrows the scope to the specific unclosed block.
*   **Limitations:**
    *   **Complex Position Mapping:** Accurately mapping a position in the final, highly simplified string back to the original source requires meticulous tracking of how each simplification step affects all subsequent character positions. This proved to be the core technical hurdle.
    *   Like the initial script, it points to the *scope* (opening `[`) rather than the precise *insertion point*.

#### c) Native Parser Error Trapping (`transcode/next`)

*   **Concept:** Leverage Rebol 3 Oldes' built-in parser (`transcode/next`) to parse the script. Catch syntax errors, particularly those related to unexpected End-Of-File (EOF) caused by missing brackets. Use the error's positional information.
*   **Implementation:** `find-missing-native.r3`.
*   **Strengths:**
    *   Uses the most authoritative understanding of Rebol syntax (Rebol itself).
    *   Can quickly identify that a syntax error exists.
*   **Limitations:**
    *   **Displaced Error Location:** In cases of deeply nested unclosed blocks, the reported error location often points to where the parser's state becomes inconsistent (e.g., the end of the last *successfully parsed* major construct) rather than the *start* of the specific unclosed block or the logical *end* where the `]` is missing.
    *   Does not directly solve the "exact line" problem.

## Decision & Chosen Solution

After evaluating all methods, the **"Report Opening Bracket Location" approach (Method 2a)** was determined to be the best practical solution for a
standalone Rebol 3 Oldes utility script. This is implemented in `find-missing-bracket-approx.r3`.

### Rationale

1.  **Reliability & Accuracy:** It robustly and accurately identifies the *scope* of the unclosed block by finding the unmatched opening bracket. This is a direct and deterministic result.
2.  **Actionable Information:** While it doesn't give the *exact* character to add the `]`, it provides the developer with the precise starting point (line/column) of the problematic block and surrounding context. This is usually sufficient for an experienced developer to quickly locate the intended end of that block and add the missing bracket.
3.  **Simplicity & Maintainability:** The script is self-contained, relatively simple compared to the iterative simplification mapping problem or the need for external grammars, and easy to understand and maintain.
4.  **No External Dependencies:** It's a pure Rebol 3 script, making it easy to distribute and run within the target environment.
5.  **Superior to Alternatives:**
    *   External tools (`ast-grep`, `ripgrep`) were either unavailable or unsuitable.
    *   Iterative simplification, while conceptually powerful, was significantly hindered by the complexity of precise position mapping, preventing it from achieving better precision than the simpler method.
    *   Native parser error trapping, although leveraging the language's strength, also suffered from reporting the error location at a structurally relevant but not *precisely useful* point for insertion.

## Conclusion

Creating a tool that automatically pinpoints the *single, exact line and column* where a missing `]` *should be inserted* is a surprisingly complex problem,
especially for a flexible language like Rebol 3. The investigation confirmed that standard script-based analysis and even direct parser error trapping struggle
to provide this level of precision without significant additional complexity (like full AST construction or intricate position tracking).

The chosen solution in `find-missing-bracket-approx.r3` offers an excellent balance.
It reliably identifies the *source* of the problem (the unclosed block's start) and provides enough context for the developer to easily resolve it.
This makes it a highly effective and practical diagnostic tool within the constraints of a standalone Rebol script, acknowledging that the final,
precise step of bracket placement often still requires human judgment based on the identified scope.
