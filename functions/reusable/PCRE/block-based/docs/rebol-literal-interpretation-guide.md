# REBOL Literal Interpretation Guide

**Document**: REBOL r3oToy RegExp Engine - Literal Interpretation Guide
**Version**: 1.0.1

**Date**: July 30, 2025

**Status**: BETA Implementation

## Overview

The REBOL r3oToy RegExp engine uses **REBOL Literal Interpretation** as a core architectural principle. This approach treats REBOL string contents as literal characters rather than following standard regex escape sequence conventions.

## Core Principle

**REBOL string contents are processed as literal characters, with escape sequences recognized through semantic tokenization rather than string-level preprocessing.**

### Design Rationale

1. **REBOL-Native Approach**: Designed specifically for REBOL, leveraging natural string handling
2. **Simplified Implementation**: Reduces complexity of escape sequence conflicts
3. **Predictable Behavior**: String contents directly correspond to match targets
4. **Performance Optimization**: Eliminates preprocessing overhead
5. **Reduced Meta-Character Conflicts**: Avoids REBOL string vs regex conflicts

## Literal Interpretation Rules

### Backslash Handling

#### Rule: Consecutive Backslashes Are Literal

```rebol
;; REBOL String Interpretation
pattern: "\\"                      ;; Two literal backslashes in REBOL
haystack: "\\"                     ;; Two literal backslashes in REBOL
result: RegExp haystack pattern     ;; → "\\" (matches both backslashes)

;; Tokenization Process
;; Input: "\\" (2 characters: \ and \)
;; Tokens: [[literal #"\"] [literal #"\"]]  ;; Two separate literal tokens
;; Rules: [#"\" #"\"]                       ;; Match two backslashes
;; Result: "\\" (successful match of both)
```

#### Rule: Single Backslash + Character = Escape Sequence

```rebol
;; Escape Sequence Recognition
pattern: "\d+"                     ;; Backslash + d + plus
haystack: "123"                    ;; Digit string
result: RegExp haystack pattern    ;; → "123" (digit class match)

;; Tokenization Process
;; Input: "\d+" (3 characters: \, d, +)
;; Tokens: [digit-class quantifier-plus]    ;; Semantic tokens
;; Rules: [some digit-charset]              ;; Match one or more digits
;; Result: "123" (successful digit match)
```

### Character Sequence Processing

#### Standard Escape Sequences (Recognized)

```rebol
;; These patterns are recognized as escape sequences:
"\d"    → [digit-class]           ;; Matches digits 0-9
"\w"    → [word-class]            ;; Matches word characters 0-9A-Za-z_
"\s"    → [space-class]           ;; Matches whitespace
"\D"    → [non-digit-class]       ;; Matches non-digits
"\W"    → [non-word-class]        ;; Matches non-word characters
"\S"    → [non-space-class]       ;; Matches non-whitespace
"\."    → [escaped-char #"."]     ;; Matches literal dot
"\+"    → [escaped-char #"+"]     ;; Matches literal plus
```

#### Literal Character Sequences

```rebol
;; These patterns are treated as literal characters:
"\\d"   → [[literal #"\"] [literal #"d"]]     ;; Matches backslash + d
"\\w"   → [[literal #"\"] [literal #"w"]]     ;; Matches backslash + w
"\\\\"  → [[literal #"\"] [literal #"\"] [literal #"\"] [literal #"\"]]  ;; Four backslashes
```

## Implementation Details

### Tokenizer Behavior

The tokenizer implements literal interpretation through consecutive backslash detection:

```rebol
;; Consecutive Backslash Detection Logic
if all [
    current-char = #"\"
    (state/position + 1) <= length? state/input
    (pick state/input (state/position + 1)) = #"\"
] [
    ;; This is \\, treat as literal backslash
    token: reduce [reduce [LITERAL #"\"]]
    state/position: state/position + 1
] else [
    ;; Regular escape sequence processing
    ProcessEscapeSequence state
]
```

### Rule Generation

Literal tokens are converted to direct character matches:

```rebol
;; Literal Token Processing
literal [
    ;; Direct character match
    append rules token/2  ;; Add character directly to rules
]

;; Example: [literal #"\"] → [#"\"] in parse rules
```

## Comparison with Standard Regex

### Backslash Interpretation Differences

| Pattern | Standard Regex | REBOL Literal | Explanation |
|---------|----------------|---------------|-------------|
| `\\` | Match one backslash | Match two backslashes | REBOL string contains two characters |
| `\d` | Match digit | Match digit | Same (escape sequence recognized) |
| `\.` | Match literal dot | Match literal dot | Same (escape sequence recognized) |
| `\\d` | Match backslash + d | Match backslash + d | REBOL string contains 3 characters |
| `\\\\` | Match two backslashes | Match four backslashes | REBOL string contains four characters |

### Practical Examples

#### Email Pattern Matching

```rebol
;; REBOL Literal Interpretation
email-pattern: "\w+@\w+\.\w+"      ;; Works as expected
RegExp "user@domain.com" email-pattern  ;; → "user@domain.com"

;; The \w and \. are recognized as escape sequences
;; No double-escaping needed
```

#### File Path Matching

```rebol
;; REBOL Literal Interpretation
path-pattern: "C:\\\w+\\\w+\.txt"  ;; Matches C:\folder\file.txt
RegExp "C:\\folder\\file.txt" path-pattern  ;; → "C:\\folder\\file.txt"

;; Each \\ in pattern matches one \ in haystack
;; \w matches word characters, \. matches literal dot
```

#### Literal Backslash Sequences

```rebol
;; Matching literal backslash sequences
pattern: "\\\\"                    ;; Four backslashes in REBOL string
haystack: "\\\\"                   ;; Four backslashes in REBOL string
RegExp haystack pattern            ;; → "\\\\" (matches all four)
```

## Best Practices

### Pattern Design

1. **Use Natural REBOL Strings**: Write patterns as you would write REBOL strings
2. **Expect Literal Behavior**: Multiple backslashes match multiple backslashes
3. **Leverage Escape Sequences**: Use `\d`, `\w`, `\s` for character classes
4. **Test Patterns**: Verify behavior matches expectations

### Migration from Standard Regex

1. **Audit Backslash Usage**: Check all `\\` patterns
2. **Test Literal Matching**: Verify backslash sequences match correctly
3. **Update Documentation**: Document pattern expectations
4. **Validate Behavior**: Use test suites to confirm migration

### Debugging Techniques

1. **Check String Contents**: Verify REBOL string contains expected characters
2. **Test Tokenization**: Use diagnostic tools to see token generation
3. **Validate Rules**: Check generated parse rules match expectations
4. **Compare Results**: Test against known good patterns

## Error Handling

### Common Issues

#### Issue: Unexpected Backslash Behavior

```rebol
;; Problem: Expecting one backslash match
RegExp "\" "\\"                    ;; → false (pattern has 2, haystack has 1)

;; Solution: Match pattern to haystack
RegExp "\" "\"                     ;; → "\" (both have 1 backslash)
RegExp "\\" "\\"                   ;; → "\\" (both have 2 backslashes)
```

#### Issue: Escape Sequence Not Recognized

```rebol
;; Problem: Literal backslash + d instead of digit class
RegExp "123" "\\d"                 ;; → false (looking for \ + d, not digits)

;; Solution: Use single backslash for escape sequences
RegExp "123" "\d"                  ;; → "1" (digit class recognized)
```

### Diagnostic Tools

```rebol
;; Check string contents
pattern: "\\\\"
print ["Pattern length:" length? pattern]
repeat i length? pattern [
    char: pick pattern i
    print ["  Position" i ":" mold char "code:" to integer! char]
]

;; Check tokenization
tokens: StringToPatternBlock pattern
print ["Tokens:" mold tokens]
```

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Integration

The literal interpretation is implemented at multiple levels:

1. **Tokenizer Level**: Consecutive backslash detection
2. **Semantic Level**: Escape sequence recognition through rules
3. **Rule Generation**: Direct character to parse rule conversion
4. **Matching Level**: Standard REBOL parse execution

### Performance Benefits

- **Zero Preprocessing**: No string manipulation required
- **Direct Tokenization**: Characters processed as encountered

- **Predictable**: Behavior matches REBOL string expectations
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new literal interpretation rules

## Conclusion

REBOL Literal Interpretation provides a natural, efficient, and predictable approach to pattern matching in REBOL. By treating string contents as literal characters and recognizing escape sequences through semantic tokenization, the engine eliminates common regex escaping issues while maintaining full functionality.
