;; PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS CONCEPT
;;=============================================================================

print "^/=== PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS CONCEPT ==="

print "String-based approach (current):"
print "  - Character-by-character parsing: O(n) per character"
print "  - Meta-character escape handling: Complex string manipulation"
print "  - Multiple parsing passes: String analysis + rule generation"
print "  - Memory overhead: Temporary string allocations"

print "^/Block-based approach (proposed):"
print "  - Token-by-token processing: O(n) per token (fewer than chars)"
print "  - Semantic token handling: Direct token processing"
print "  - Single pass processing: Tokens -> rules directly"
print "  - Memory efficiency: Block structures, no string manipulation"

print "^/Expected improvements:"
print "  - Tokenization: 2-3x faster than character parsing"
print "  - Rule generation: 3-5x faster with semantic tokens"
print "  - Memory usage: 20-30% reduction in allocations"
print "  - Scalability: Better performance with complex patterns"

print "1. ✅ Solves ^ meta-character conflict (^ -> anchor-start token)"

print "3. ✅ Improves performance (token processing vs character parsing)"
print "4. ✅ Enhances maintainability (semantic tokens vs string manipulation)"
print "5. ✅ Enables better error handling (token-level validation)"
