# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for enhancing the REBOL 3 Regular Expressions Engine to properly handle escape sequences and provide robust pattern matching capabilities. The engine currently has issues with escape sequences like `\d`, `\w`, and `\s` that need to be resolved to provide reliable regular expression functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a REBOL developer, I want to use standard escape sequences in regular expressions, so that I can write portable and intuitive pattern matching code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a regular expression contains `\d` THEN the system SHALL match any digit character (0-9)
2. WHEN a regular expression contains `\w` THEN the system SHALL match any word character (letters, digits, underscore)
3. WHEN a regular expression contains `\s` THEN the system SHALL match any whitespace character (space, tab, newline)
4. WHEN escape sequences are used with quantifiers (+, *, ?, {n}) THEN the system SHALL apply the quantifier to the escape sequence correctly

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a REBOL developer, I want quantifiers to work properly with escape sequences, so that I can match patterns like "one or more digits" or "zero or more whitespace".

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a regular expression contains `\d+` THEN the system SHALL match one or more consecutive digits
2. WHEN a regular expression contains `\w*` THEN the system SHALL match zero or more consecutive word characters
3. WHEN a regular expression contains `\s?` THEN the system SHALL match zero or one whitespace character
4. WHEN a regular expression contains `\d{3}` THEN the system SHALL match exactly 3 digits
5. WHEN a regular expression contains `\w{2,5}` THEN the system SHALL match between 2 and 5 word characters

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a REBOL developer, I want the regular expression engine to handle parse errors gracefully, so that invalid patterns don't crash my application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an invalid escape sequence is encountered THEN the system SHALL return an error message instead of crashing
2. WHEN malformed quantifiers are used THEN the system SHALL provide clear error feedback
3. WHEN the parse operation fails THEN the system SHALL return false or none instead of throwing an exception

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a REBOL developer, I want comprehensive test coverage for escape sequences, so that I can trust the regular expression engine's reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing `\d` patterns THEN the system SHALL correctly identify digits and reject non-digits
2. WHEN testing `\w` patterns THEN the system SHALL correctly identify word characters and reject punctuation
3. WHEN testing `\s` patterns THEN the system SHALL correctly identify all whitespace types
4. WHEN testing quantified escape sequences THEN the system SHALL handle all quantifier combinations correctly
5. WHEN running comprehensive tests THEN the system SHALL achieve a 100% success rate

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a REBOL developer, I want the RegExp function to integrate seamlessly with the fixed escape sequences, so that I can use it as a drop-in replacement for other regex engines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calling RegExp with escape sequence patterns THEN the system SHALL return correct match results
2. WHEN using complex patterns combining literals and escape sequences THEN the system SHALL parse them correctly
3. WHEN the pattern matches THEN the system SHALL return the matched portion
4. WHEN the pattern doesn't match THEN the system SHALL return false
5. WHEN there's a parsing error or other error condition THEN the system SHALL return none
