The simplified approach using `set/any 'result try test-code` represents a more efficient and cleaner implementation for error handling in REBOL.

## Error Handling Simplification in Test Code

The original pattern `set/any 'result try/with test-code function [error] [error]` contains unnecessary complexity. The `try/with` construct with an error handler that simply returns the error object provides no additional value over the direct `try` operation, which automatically returns error objects when exceptions occur.

## Technical Analysis

The `try` function in REBOL inherently captures errors and returns them as error objects without requiring explicit error handling logic. When code executes successfully, `try` returns the normal result. When an error occurs, `try` automatically returns the error object. This behavior eliminates the need for custom error handlers in simple test scenarios where the objective is merely to capture potential errors for subsequent analysis.

The `set/any` prefix ensures that both successful results and error objects are properly assigned to the result variable, regardless of the returned value type. This combination provides comprehensive error capture with minimal code complexity.

## Practical Implementation Benefits

This simplified approach reduces code verbosity while maintaining full error handling capabilities. Test harnesses benefit from cleaner, more readable code that focuses on the essential testing logic rather than complex error handling constructs. The pattern becomes particularly valuable in test suites where multiple function calls require error checking, as the consistent `set/any 'result try test-code` pattern can be applied uniformly across all test cases.

## Integration with Existing Test Patterns

This simplification aligns well with the established error handling standards that emphasize returning error objects rather than throwing exceptions. Test functions can use the simplified pattern to capture results, then apply `error? result` checks to determine whether the operation succeeded or failed. This approach maintains consistency with the broader error handling philosophy while reducing implementation complexity.

The correction highlights an important principle in REBOL development: leveraging the language's built-in capabilities rather than implementing custom solutions when the native functionality already provides the required behavior. This approach results in more maintainable code that aligns with REBOL's design philosophy of providing powerful, concise solutions to common programming challenges.
