# Repository Overview

## General Repository Details

### Purpose
The repository is dedicated to demonstrating and ensuring the quality of Rebol 3 Oldes functions.  The main goal, as stated in `README.md`, is to provide comprehensive demonstrations of specified Rebol functions, highlighting their use cases, quirks and potential issues.  It also aims to verify `function` behavior against expected outcomes.

### Main Directories
- `blocks/`: Contains Rebol scripts demonstrating operations on `block!` data types.  For example, `blocks/blocks_demo.r3` was found.
- `functions/`: Appears to house scripts demonstrating specific Rebol functions.  Examples include `functions/alter-ask.r3` and `functions/alter.r3`.

### Nature of Rebol Scripts
The scripts found (`blocks/blocks_demo.r3`, `functions/alter-ask.r3`, `functions/alter.r3`) are demonstration and quality assurance scripts, aligning with the repository's purpose of showcasing and testing Rebol functions.

### `project_rules.md` Significance
This document is highly significant.  It outlines strict rules for Rebol 3 Oldes programming, including `function` definitions, constant definitions, scoping, error handling and coding style.  It also defines a detailed project management and task breakdown methodology, including how to structure project plans, define tasks and manage phases of development.  It even specifies Markdown and English language style preferences for documentation.  This file serves as a comprehensive guide for any contributor.

## Summary of File Contents

### `README.md`
This file defines the project as a "Rebol 3 Oldes Function Demonstration and Quality Assurance Framework".  Its main purpose is to comprehensively demonstrate specified Rebol functions, highlight use cases, identify quirks and verify behavior against expected outcomes.  It outlines core features for demo scripts (comprehensive demonstrations across data types, practical examples, clear output with PASS/FAIL status, helper functions), the technical stack (Rebol 3 Oldes, CLI script, no external libraries), key reliability goals and a definition of "Done".

### `blocks/blocks_demo.r3`
This script is a demonstration of Rebol `block!` operations.  It includes examples of literal `block!` creation, `block!` creation with `make` (including shallow vs.  deep copies), `to-block` and `load`, `append`, `insert`, `copy` (shallow and `/part`), advanced `append` and `insert` refinements (`/part`, `/dup`), `change` (with all its refinements), `remove`, `clear` and `copy/deep`.  It also discusses `copy/types` and provides a workaround.  The script is heavily commented.

### `functions/alter-ask.r3`
This script demonstrates the Rebol `alter` `function` with interactive `ask` input.  It shows examples of modifying blocks based on user input for various use cases like managing configurations, file extensions, user lists etc.  It uses helper functions `safe-sort` and `safe-block-compare` for verification.

### `functions/alter.r3`
This script is a comprehensive demonstration of the `alter` `function`.  It explains `alter`'s purpose and related functions, then showcases its use with numerous data types for both addition and removal, including the `/case` refinement.  It features advanced examples like using `alter`'s return value, `alter` modifying literal blocks in loops and various practical scenarios (cycling formats, zigzag text, toggling visibility, encoding methods, comment styles, progress bars).  It also includes "lessons learned" from development.

### `project_rules.md`
This file acts as a detailed coding and project management guide.  It defines roles, Rebol version, programming requirements (e.g., `function` vs `func`, `protect`, scoping), project management methodology ("Task Master Overview") and specifies Markdown/English style preferences for documentation.
