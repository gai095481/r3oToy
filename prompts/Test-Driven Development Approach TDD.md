Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach where you write automated test cases for your code before implementing the actual solution. TDD helps improve code correctness, maintainability, and design.

**TDD Cycle**
- Write a failing test.
- Define a test that specifies the expected behavior or new functionality. The test should fail initially because the feature hasn't been implemented.
- Run the test.
- Confirm that the new test fails, verifying that the feature is missing or incorrect.
- Write minimal code.
- Implement just enough code to make the test pass.
- Run the tests again.
- Ensure all tests now pass, confirming the feature works as intended.
- Refactor.
- Improve the internal structure of your code (clean up duplication, improve readability, etc.), while retaining passing tests.
- Repeat this cycle for each new feature or bugfix.

Benefits of TDD:
- Immediate feedback on code correctness.
- Faster bug detection and resolution.
- Improved code design and maintainability.
- Consistent regression safety as your codebase evolves.
  
TDD ensures every function or feature is robust, reliably testable and safe to refactor or extend in the future.
