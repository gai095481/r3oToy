**Purpose of this AI-Guided Task:**
*   To help you, the **solo developer**, work with me, your **AI coding assistant**, to respond to a project change in a structured way using a `change-checklist`.
*   I will help you analyze how this change affects your project's goals, key features, and existing code or plans.
*   We'll explore solutions together (like adjusting scope, rolling back a feature, or modifying a feature).
*   I will draft specific, actionable updates to your project notes, code comments, task lists, or any other relevant documents based on our analysis.
*   The main outcome will be a clear "Change Impact & Action Plan" document that summarizes our findings and the proposed changes for you to approve and implement.
*   If the change is very large, I'll help you identify if it requires a fundamental rethink of the project.

**Instructions for Us (You, the Developer, and Me, the AI Assistant):**

**1. Getting Started & How We'll Work:**
*   **Confirming the Task:**
    *   I understand we're starting the "Correct Course Task" because something has triggered a need for a change in the project.
    *   **You'll need to tell me:**
        1.  What's the change trigger or the issue you've encountered?
        2.  What's your initial understanding of the problem and how it might impact the project?
    *   Please ensure I have access to (or you can provide snippets from) any relevant project materials (e.g., your current task list, feature descriptions, code snippets, design notes) and the `change-checklist` we'll be using.
*   **Choosing Our Interaction Style:**
    *   How would you like to work through this?
        1.  **"Step-by-Step (Recommended):** We can go through the `change-checklist` section by section. We'll discuss each part, I'll analyze its impact, and I'll draft proposed changes for that section before we move on. This is thorough and good for detailed adjustments."
        2.  **"Quick Scan & Consolidate:** Or, I can do a faster, more high-level analysis based on the checklist and then present you with a combined set of findings and proposed changes for a single big review. This can be quicker upfront but might mean a larger review for you later."
    *   Please let me know your preferred style. Once you choose, I'll confirm, (e.g., "Okay, we'll proceed Step-by-Step.").
*   **Our Process:** I'll now use the `change-checklist` to help us analyze the change and draft the necessary updates, following the interaction style you've selected.

**2. Analyzing the Change with the Checklist:**
*   I will guide us systematically through the relevant sections of the `change-checklist` (usually covering the context of the change, impact on features, conflicts with existing plans/code, and evaluating the best way forward).
*   For each checklist item (or group of items, depending on our chosen style):
    *   I'll present the questions or points from the checklist.
    *   I'll ask you for any information I need. I will also actively analyze any project materials you've provided to assess the impact.
    *   We'll discuss my findings for each item.
    *   I'll keep a record of our decisions for each checklist item (e.g., `[x] Addressed`, `[N/A]`, `[!] Needs more thought`) and any important notes.
    *   Together, we'll agree on the "Recommended Path Forward" as prompted by the checklist.

**3. Drafting the Proposed Changes:**
*   Based on our checklist analysis and the "Recommended Path Forward" we've agreed on:
    *   I will identify the specific project materials that need updating (e.g., specific tasks in your to-do list, feature descriptions, sections in your project notes, code comments, diagrams).
    *   **I will draft the proposed changes directly and clearly.** For example:
        *   Revising a task description or its acceptance criteria.
        *   Adding, removing, or reordering tasks.
        *   Suggesting changes to code comments or proposing modifications to a small diagram (I can provide an updated Mermaid diagram block or a clear text description of the change).
        *   Updating notes on technology choices or specific sections in your project documentation.
        *   Drafting new, brief notes if needed for a specific decision.
    *   If we're in "Step-by-Step" mode, we'll discuss and refine these drafted changes for each item as we go.
    *   If we're in "Quick Scan & Consolidate" mode, I'll compile all these drafted changes to show you in the next step.

**4. Creating Your "Change Impact & Action Plan":**
*   I will synthesize our complete `change-checklist` analysis and all the agreed-upon proposed changes into a single document called "Change Impact & Action Plan."
*   This plan will clearly present:
    *   **Analysis Summary:** A brief overview of the original issue, its analyzed impact (on your project's scope, features, and goals), and why we chose the recommended path forward.
    *   **Specific Proposed Changes:** For each affected part of your project, I'll clearly show or describe the exact changes (e.g., "Change Task 'X' description from: [old text] To: [new text]", "Add new checklist item to Task 'Y': [new item]", "Update project notes Section 3.2 as follows: [new/modified text or diagram description]").
*   I'll present the complete draft of this "Change Impact & Action Plan" to you for your final review and feedback. We can make any final adjustments you request.

**5. Finalizing & Deciding Your Next Steps:**
*   I'll ask for your explicit approval of the "Change Impact & Action Plan," including all the specific changes documented within it.
*   I will provide you with the finalized "Change Impact & Action Plan" document (e.g., in markdown).
*   **Based on the nature of the approved changes:**
    *   **If the changes are manageable and directly address the issue:** The "Correct Course Task" (our analysis and proposal part) is complete. You can now proceed with implementing these changes in your actual project files, code, and task lists.
    *   **If our analysis shows the change is very large and might require a fundamental rethink of your project (e.g., significantly changes the core idea, makes the current approach unfeasible):** I will clearly state this. This means you'll need to consider if you want to proceed with such a major shift. The "Change Impact & Action Plan" will serve as critical input for your strategic decision-making.

**Our Main Deliverable for You:**
*   **Primary:** A "Change Impact & Action Plan" document (in markdown format). This document will contain:
    *   A summary of our `change-checklist` analysis (the issue, its impact, and why we chose a particular solution path).
    *   Specific, clearly drafted proposed edits for your project materials.
*   **Internal Record:** I will also keep an implicit record of the completed `change-checklist` items, reflecting our discussions and decisions.
