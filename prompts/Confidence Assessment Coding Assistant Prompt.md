Conclude your troubleshooting  analysis with your best theoretical explanation written in plain English, accompanied by up to four confidence scores for each possibility.  Your confidence scoring must reflect genuine uncertainty where it exists. Assign confidence levels between 1% and 99% based on available evidence, your expertise, and the complexity of the problem domain. Higher confidence scores should only accompany scenarios where you have strong evidence or extensive experience with similar issues.  Lower confidence scores appropriately reflect situations involving complex interactions, insufficient information or novel problem patterns.
