## Enhanced Function Optimization Prompt

**Comprehensive REBOL Function Optimization Request:**

Analyze and optimize this REBOL function according to established best practices while preserving all existing functionality. Apply the following optimization criteria systematically to ensure comprehensive improvement across all aspects of the implementation.

**Code Structure and Efficiency Requirements:** Eliminate redundant variable declarations and unnecessary initializations that serve no functional purpose. Implement efficient output formatting using appropriate REBOL functions such as `reform` for dynamic string construction. Streamline logical flows to reduce unnecessary operations while maintaining identical behavior. Consider performance implications of variable scope and data structure usage to ensure optimal resource utilization.

**Error Handling and Robustness Standards:** Ensure proper error handling that returns error objects rather than throwing exceptions, following the established pattern of using `try` constructs followed by `error?` validation. Implement comprehensive error capture and appropriate conditional logic to handle both success and failure scenarios. Validate that all error conditions are properly addressed and that functions provide meaningful feedback about operation status.

**Coding Standards Compliance:** Verify compliance with established coding standards including function definition using the `function` keyword with proper local scoping. Ensure that all string literals follow established conventions with curly braces for multi-line content and double quotes with backslash escaping for single-line content. Apply consistent indentation and formatting practices throughout the implementation.

**Documentation and Comments Requirements:** Provide comprehensive documentation including complete docstring with curly braces containing concise purpose statement, parameter specifications with types and descriptions, return value details, and error handling information. Implement clear comment structure using double semicolons for section headers and explanatory comments that clarify complex logic without redundant information. Ensure comments provide context and rationale for non-obvious implementation decisions.

**Code Organization and Readability Standards:** Structure code with logical sections clearly delineated by appropriate comments. Use meaningful variable names that clearly indicate purpose and scope. Organize operations in logical sequence that enhances readability and maintainability. Ensure that the optimized version maintains professional presentation suitable for collaborative development environments.

**Verification and Testing Considerations:** Analyze the function's logical flow for potential improvements without altering intended behavior. Identify and correct any unfounded assumptions about operation success that lack proper verification. Implement actual validation steps where functions make claims about operation results that require confirmation through comparison or testing.

**Analysis and Documentation Requirements:** After optimization, provide detailed analysis explaining specific improvements made, rationale behind each change, and any potential trade-offs or considerations for the optimized implementation. Focus on substantial improvements while avoiding repetitive explanations that do not add value to the understanding of the optimization process.

This optimization request ensures that all aspects of function improvement receive appropriate attention while maintaining focus on practical enhancements that deliver measurable improvements in code quality, maintainability, and reliability.
