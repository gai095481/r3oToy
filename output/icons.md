Best Practices:
Consistency: Use the same icon for identical concepts (e.g., always ❌ for failures).
Accessibility: Pair icons with text (e.g., ✅ PASSED not just ✅).
Context: Choose universally recognizable symbols (e.g., 📂 for folders is clearer than 📁).
Sparingly: Overuse reduces impact – reserve for key statuses.
